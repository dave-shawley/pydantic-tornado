title: TODO

This is simply a collection of things that I would like this library to
do that it doesn't currently do. I might eventually organize these into
milestones or whatever, but I'm not that organized at the moment.

## OpenAPI

* document parameter annotations in some sensible way
* add header support via injections
* shared schema for pydantic models
* response models
* figure out how to describe status codes

## Injections

* add header support
* add authorization model

## Other

* error handling hooks
* support for PEP-695 `type` aliases
